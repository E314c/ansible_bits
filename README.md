# Ansible Bits
This is just a collection of ansible tasks I've written up.
I needed somewhere central to store them so I can `ctrl-c ctrl-v` them into whichever projects I need later on.

Most of this were written to aid in the building of Ubuntu VMs via Vagrant/Ansible.
I think the `ui` task is currently the only one that is ubuntu specific, but even then it's only the package name for `ubuntu-desktop` aggregate package. I don't know what the alternative for Debian is.
